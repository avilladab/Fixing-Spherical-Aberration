# Fixing-Spherical-Aberration
This program calculates the Z step correction factor due to a mismatch in the Refractive Indices (Spherical Aberration) between the objective's immerse medium (water, oil, etc) and the sample.

First, it calculates the Refractive Index (RI) of a sample (n2) given the refractive indices of the particles (np) and the solvent (ns), by using the packing fraction phi,
n<sub>2</sub> = &phi;n<sub>p</sub> + (1-&phi;)n<sub>s</sub>

After calculating the sample's RI n2, it uses the immersion medium RI n1 (from the input in the header) and calculates the corrected step given a step in Z (the default is 0.25 in microns).

The correction factor is calculated with 4 different approaches:

   1) Carlsson's correction
     (n<sub>2</sub>/n<sub>1</sub>)
   2) Visser's correction
     tan(sin<sup>-1</sup>(NA/n<sub>1</sub>))/tan(sin<sup>-1</sup>(NA/n<sub>2</sub>))
   3) Mean correction
   4) Median correction

The mean correction calculates the mean depth where 100 rays equally spaced along the radius of an objectiveâ€™s front lens intersect the optical axis in the sample, and the median correction calculates the median intersection point.
